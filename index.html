      <div>Web developers are found working in various types of organizations, including large corporations and
        governments, small and medium-sized companies, or alone as freelancers. Some web developers work for one
        organization as a permanent full-time employee, while others may work as independent consultants, or as
        contractors for an agency or at home personal use. Web developers typically handle both server-side and front-end
        logic. This usually involves implementing all the visual elements that users see and use in the web applications,
        as well as all the web services that are necessary to power the usage of their developing work. Salaries vary
        depending on the type of development work, location, and level of seniority.
